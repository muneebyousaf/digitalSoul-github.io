# VRMS - Virtual Richard M. Stallman

VRMS, which stands for Virtual Richard M. Stallman, is a useful tool for users of Debian-based Linux distributions to check the status of installed software packages concerning their compliance with the Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).

The DFSG outlines the criteria that determine whether a software package is considered free and open source. It is a fundamental aspect of Debian's commitment to providing a completely free and open-source software environment for its users.

VRMS works by scanning the package database of your Debian-based system and identifying any packages that do not adhere to the DFSG. These non-free or proprietary packages are reported to the user, allowing them to make informed decisions about whether to keep or replace them with open-source alternatives.

VRMS is a valuable tool for those who prioritize using exclusively open-source software on their Linux systems. By running VRMS, you can maintain a Debian-based system that aligns with the principles of software freedom advocated by Richard M. Stallman and the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

To use VRMS on your Debian-based system, you can install it with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install vrms
```

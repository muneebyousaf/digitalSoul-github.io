# How to sleep with a wait queue 1/3

##  `wait_queue_head_t`
`wait_queue_head_t` is a data structure in the Linux kernel used for managing wait queues. Wait queues are a fundamental mechanism in the kernel for synchronization and process blocking. They are commonly used in scenarios where one or more processes or threads need to wait for a specific condition to be satisfied before proceeding.

Here's an overview of `wait_queue_head_t` and its usage:

1. **Definition**: `wait_queue_head_t` is defined in the Linux kernel as a data structure that represents a wait queue head. It is typically implemented as a pointer to an internal kernel structure.

2. **Initialization**: Before using a wait queue, it must be initialized using the `init_waitqueue_head()` function. This function initializes the wait queue and prepares it for use. For example:

   ```c
   wait_queue_head_t my_wait_queue;
   init_waitqueue_head(&my_wait_queue);
   ```

3. **Wait Queue Operations**: Wait queues are associated with specific conditions or events. Threads or processes can add themselves to a wait queue using functions like `wait_event()` or `wait_event_interruptible()`. These functions block the caller until the specified condition becomes true.

4. **Waking Up Waiters**: When the condition for which threads are waiting becomes true, another part of the kernel can wake up the waiting threads using functions like `wake_up()` or `wake_up_interruptible()`. This signals to the waiting threads that they can continue execution.

   ```c
   wake_up(&my_wait_queue); // Wake up all waiters
   ```

5. **Blocking and Unblocking**: Threads waiting on a wait queue are effectively blocked until they are woken up. This blocking behavior ensures synchronization between different parts of the kernel or between kernel and user space.

6. **Concurrency**: `wait_queue_head_t` is designed to be used in a multi-threaded or multi-process environment. It provides the necessary synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions and ensure orderly execution.

Overall, `wait_queue_head_t` is a crucial component in the Linux kernel for managing synchronization and blocking of processes or threads. It allows for efficient waiting and waking of threads based on specific conditions, which is essential for various kernel operations, including device drivers, interprocess communication, and more.

### Step by step guid to use wait queues 

In the Linux kernel, you can set a wait condition for a specific process by using a combination of the `wait_queue_head_t`, `wait_event()`, and `wake_up()` functions. Here's a step-by-step guide along with an example:

1. **Initialize the Wait Queue Head**: First, you need to initialize a `wait_queue_head_t` structure. This structure represents the wait queue associated with your specific condition. You can initialize it as follows:

   ```c
   wait_queue_head_t my_wait_queue;
   init_waitqueue_head(&my_wait_queue);
   ```

2. **Set Up the Wait Condition**: Define a condition that the process will wait for. This condition should be protected by a mutex or other synchronization mechanism. For example, you might want to wait until a specific flag becomes true.

   ```c
   bool my_condition = false;
   DEFINE_MUTEX(my_mutex); // Use a mutex to protect the condition.
   ```

3. **Add Process to the Wait Queue**: In the process that wants to wait for the condition, you can add the process to the wait queue using the `wait_event()` macro. This macro checks the condition and blocks the process if the condition is not satisfied.

   ```c
   wait_event(my_wait_queue, my_condition == true);
   ```

   This line of code will block the current process until `my_condition` becomes `true`.

4. **Change the Condition and Wake Up**: In another part of the code where the condition is changed (typically when the condition becomes true), you need to update the condition and wake up the waiting process. Use the mutex to protect concurrent access to the condition.

   ```c
   mutex_lock(&my_mutex);
   my_condition = true; // Change the condition.
   mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);

   wake_up(&my_wait_queue); // Wake up the waiting process.
   ```

   This code updates the condition, unlocks the mutex, and then wakes up the waiting process.

Here's a complete example of how to use these steps in a simple kernel module:

```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/kthread.h>
#include <linux/delay.h>

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");

static wait_queue_head_t my_wait_queue;
static bool my_condition = false;
DEFINE_MUTEX(my_mutex);

static int my_thread(void *data) {
    pr_info("Thread started\n");

    mutex_lock(&my_mutex);
    while (!kthread_should_stop() && !my_condition) {
        pr_info("Thread waiting\n");
        mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);

        // Wait for the condition to become true.
        wait_event(my_wait_queue, my_condition == true);

        mutex_lock(&my_mutex);
    }
    mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);

    pr_info("Thread exiting\n");
    return 0;
}

static struct task_struct *thread;

static int __init my_init(void) {
    pr_info("Module loaded\n");

    init_waitqueue_head(&my_wait_queue);

    // Start the waiting thread.
    thread = kthread_run(my_thread, NULL, "my_thread");
    if (IS_ERR(thread)) {
        pr_err("Failed to start thread\n");
        return -EFAULT;
    }

    // Simulate a condition change after a delay.
    msleep(3000); // Sleep for 3 seconds.

    mutex_lock(&my_mutex);
    my_condition = true; // Change the condition.
    mutex_unlock(&my_mutex);

    wake_up(&my_wait_queue); // Wake up the waiting process.

    return 0;
}

static void __exit my_exit(void) {
    pr_info("Module unloaded\n");

    // Stop the thread.
    kthread_stop(thread);
}

module_init(my_init);
module_exit(my_exit);
```

In this example, a kernel thread (`my_thread`) is created, which waits for the `my_condition` flag to become true. The condition is changed after a delay, and the waiting thread is woken up.

Remember that this is a simple example, and in practice, you should handle error conditions and synchronization carefully to avoid potential issues.


# How to sleep with a waitqueue 2/3

## `wait_event`

The `wait_event` macro in the Linux kernel is used to put a process to sleep until a specified condition becomes true. It is typically used in conjunction with a wait queue and a condition that other parts of the code can signal when they want to wake up the waiting process.

The basic syntax of `wait_event` is as follows:

```c
wait_event(wait_queue, condition);
```

- `wait_queue`: This is the wait queue head (initialized using `DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD`) that represents the queue of processes waiting for the condition to become true.

- `condition`: This is the condition that the waiting process is checking. The process will sleep (block) until this condition evaluates to true.

Here's an example of how you might use `wait_event`:

```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/sched.h>
#include <linux/wait.h>

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");

DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD(module_queue);
static bool condition = false;

static int my_thread(void *data) {
    pr_info("Thread started\n");

    while (!kthread_should_stop()) {
        pr_info("Thread waiting\n");
        
        // Sleep until the condition becomes true.
        wait_event(module_queue, condition == true);

        pr_info("Thread woken up: condition is true\n");
        // Process the condition here.
    }

    pr_info("Thread exiting\n");
    return 0;
}

static struct task_struct *thread;

static int __init my_init(void) {
    pr_info("Module loaded\n");

    // Start the waiting thread.
    thread = kthread_run(my_thread, NULL, "my_thread");
    if (IS_ERR(thread)) {
        pr_err("Failed to start thread\n");
        return -EFAULT;
    }

    // Simulate a condition change after a delay.
    msleep(3000); // Sleep for 3 seconds.

    condition = true; // Change the condition.
    wake_up(&module_queue); // Wake up the waiting process.

    return 0;
}

static void __exit my_exit(void) {
    pr_info("Module unloaded\n");

    // Stop the thread.
    kthread_stop(thread);
}

module_init(my_init);
module_exit(my_exit);
```

In this example, we have a kernel thread (`my_thread`) that waits for the `condition` flag to become true using `wait_event(module_queue, condition == true)`. The waiting process will be put to sleep until the condition becomes true. In the `my_init` function, we simulate a condition change by setting `condition` to true and waking up the waiting process using `wake_up(&module_queue)`.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and in real-world scenarios, proper synchronization and error handling should be implemented.


## `wait_event_killable`

The `wait_event_killable` function in the Linux kernel is similar to `wait_event`, but it allows a task to be interrupted by a signal from user space while it's waiting for the specified condition to become true. It provides a way to wait for a condition while still being responsive to signals that can terminate or interrupt the waiting process.

The basic syntax of `wait_event_killable` is as follows:

```c
int wait_event_killable(wait_queue_head_t *queue, condition);
```

- `queue`: This is the wait queue head that represents the queue of tasks waiting for the condition to become true.

- `condition`: This is the C expression that is evaluated repeatedly. The task will sleep until this expression becomes true.

Here's how `wait_event_killable` works:

1. When a task reaches the `wait_event_killable` macro, it checks the `condition`. If the condition is already true, the task continues executing without any sleep.

2. If the condition is false, the task will be put to sleep, and it will remain in a sleep state until one of the following occurs:
   
   - The condition becomes true, in which case the task is woken up and proceeds with its execution.
   
   - A signal is sent to the task from user space. If the signal is one that can terminate the process (e.g., SIGKILL), the task will be terminated. If the signal is not a termination signal (e.g., SIGINT), the task will be woken up, and it can handle the signal as needed.

3. Once the task wakes up, it re-evaluates the `condition` and proceeds accordingly.

`wait_event_killable` is useful in scenarios where you want a task to wait for a condition while still allowing user space signals to interrupt the waiting process gracefully. This can be helpful for tasks that need to be responsive to user-initiated actions while performing potentially blocking operations.

Keep in mind that, like `wait_event`, it is usually used within kernel threads and not in user space processes. Additionally, you need to handle signals appropriately in your kernel code to ensure that the task responds to them as expected.


## `wait_event_interruptible` 

The `wait_event_interruptible` function in the Linux kernel is used for waiting until a specified condition becomes true, similar to `wait_event`. However, it has the additional feature of allowing the waiting task to be interrupted by signals from user space. If a signal is sent to the task while it is waiting, the task will be awakened, and the function will return a special value to indicate that it was interrupted.

Here is the basic syntax of `wait_event_interruptible`:

```c
int wait_event_interruptible(wait_queue_head_t *queue, condition);
```

- `queue`: This is the wait queue head representing the queue of tasks waiting for the condition to become true.

- `condition`: This is the C expression that is evaluated repeatedly. The task will sleep until this expression becomes true.

The behavior of `wait_event_interruptible` can be summarized as follows:

1. If the condition is already true when the task reaches the `wait_event_interruptible` call, the task will not sleep and will proceed with its execution.

2. If the condition is false, the task will be put to sleep, and it will remain in a sleep state until one of the following events occurs:

   - The condition becomes true, in which case the task is woken up and continues executing.

   - A signal from user space is sent to the task. If the signal is one that can terminate the process (e.g., SIGKILL), the task will be terminated. If the signal is not a termination signal (e.g., SIGINT), the task will be woken up, and the `wait_event_interruptible` function will return a value indicating that it was interrupted.

3. After waking up, the task re-evaluates the `condition` and proceeds accordingly.

The return value of `wait_event_interruptible` is important for handling interruptions. It returns one of the following values:

- 0: If the condition becomes true before the task is interrupted, or if the task is awakened without being interrupted by a signal.

- -ERESTARTSYS: If the task is interrupted by a signal, the function returns this value to indicate that the system call should be restarted. This is often used in system calls that can be automatically restarted after interruption.

- -ERESTARTNOINTR: Similar to -ERESTARTSYS, this value is used when a signal interrupts the task, but it is not automatically restarted. The task is responsible for handling the interruption.

- -ERESTARTNOHAND: Similar to -ERESTARTSYS and -ERESTARTNOINTR, but it indicates that the task should be restarted without invoking any signal handlers.

In summary, `wait_event_interruptible` is useful when you want a task to wait for a condition while still allowing user space signals to potentially interrupt the waiting process. This is often used in scenarios where you need the task to remain responsive to user-initiated actions while waiting for a specific condition to be met.

# How to sleep with completions 1/2


Sleeping with completions in the Linux kernel is a technique used to synchronize the execution of threads or tasks. Completions are often used to wait for a specific event to occur before allowing a thread to proceed. Here's how you can use completions to sleep and wake up a task:

1. **Initialize the Completion**: First, you need to initialize a completion structure. You typically do this in the thread or function that will be waiting for an event to occur.

   ```c
   DECLARE_COMPLETION(my_completion);
   ```

2. **Sleeping with Completion**: When you want a thread to sleep until a certain event happens, you can use the `wait_for_completion` function.

   ```c
   int wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(struct completion *x, unsigned long timeout);
   ```

   This function will put the current task to sleep until the associated completion is completed or a timeout occurs. It can be interrupted by signals, and it returns `0` on successful completion, `-ERESTARTSYS` if interrupted by a signal, or `-ETIME` on timeout.

   Example:

   ```c
   int result = wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(&my_completion, msecs_to_jiffies(1000));
   if (result == 0) {
       // Completion occurred successfully
   } else if (result == -ERESTARTSYS) {
       // Interrupted by a signal
   } else if (result == -ETIME) {
       // Timeout occurred
   }
   ```

3. **Waking Up with Completion**: When the event you are waiting for happens (usually in another part of the code), you can complete the associated completion using the `complete` function.

   ```c
   void complete(struct completion *x);
   ```

   Example:

   ```c
   // Event occurred
   complete(&my_completion);
   ```

Using completions in this way allows one part of the code to sleep until a specific event occurs in another part of the code. It's a common synchronization mechanism in the Linux kernel for scenarios where one task needs to wait for another task to complete some work.
# How to sleep with completions 2/2

## `reinit_completion` 
The `reinit_completion` function in the Linux kernel is used to reinitialize a completion structure. This function is useful when you want to reuse a completion structure for multiple wait-sleep-wake cycles. It resets the state of the completion to the "not done" state.

Here's the prototype of the `reinit_completion` function:

```c
void reinit_completion(struct completion *done);
```

After calling `reinit_completion`, the completion structure is ready to be used again as if it were just initialized.

Here's an example of how you might use `reinit_completion`:

```c
DECLARE_COMPLETION(my_completion);

// Wait for the first event
int result = wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(&my_completion, msecs_to_jiffies(1000));
if (result == 0) {
    // Completion occurred successfully
} else if (result == -ERESTARTSYS) {
    // Interrupted by a signal
} else if (result == -ETIME) {
    // Timeout occurred
}

// Reinitialize the completion for the next event
reinit_completion(&my_completion);

// Wait for the next event
result = wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout(&my_completion, msecs_to_jiffies(1000));
if (result == 0) {
    // Completion occurred successfully
} else if (result == -ERESTARTSYS) {
    // Interrupted by a signal
} else if (result == -ETIME) {
    // Timeout occurred
}
```

In this example, we first use `wait_for_completion_interruptible_timeout` to wait for an event using the `my_completion` structure. After the first event, we call `reinit_completion` to reset the `my_completion` structure, and then we can use it again for waiting for the next event.

This allows you to efficiently reuse completion structures without needing to allocate new ones for each wait-sleep-wake cycle.



# Waiting when there is no interrupt

The `cpu_relax()` function is a hint to the CPU that the current thread is in a spin-wait loop and can be descheduled briefly to allow other threads to run. It's a way to implement spinning loops without burning unnecessary CPU cycles.

In essence, `cpu_relax()` is used to inform the CPU that it should yield the current thread's time slice and give other threads a chance to run. It's commonly used in spinlocks and other synchronization primitives to avoid busy-waiting and reduce CPU contention.

Here's a simple example of how `cpu_relax()` might be used:

```c
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/delay.h>

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");

static int my_module_init(void) {
    unsigned long i;

    printk(KERN_INFO "Starting a busy-wait loop\n");

    for (i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {
        // Perform some work

        // Yield the CPU to allow other threads to run
        cpu_relax();
    }

    printk(KERN_INFO "Busy-wait loop finished\n");
    return 0;
}

static void my_module_exit(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "Exiting the module\n");
}

module_init(my_module_init);
module_exit(my_module_exit);
```

In this example, we're using `cpu_relax()` inside a busy-wait loop to perform some work. Inside the loop, we call `cpu_relax()` to yield the CPU, allowing other threads to execute. This is a more efficient way to implement busy-waiting compared to simply using an empty loop, as it reduces CPU contention.

Keep in mind that `cpu_relax()` is just a hint, and the actual behavior might vary between different CPU architectures and kernel versions. It's a way to improve system performance by reducing the overhead of busy-waiting, but it should be used judiciously.


# Waiting when hardware is involved

## `read[bwlq]_poll[_timeout[_atomic]]`

The `read[bwlq]_poll[_timeout[_atomic]]` functions are part of the Linux kernel's I/O access and polling API. These functions are used to perform polled reads of memory-mapped I/O registers. They are typically used in device drivers to interact with hardware registers.

Here's a breakdown of the function parameters:

- `addr`: This parameter represents the address of the I/O register you want to read from. It can be a memory-mapped address that corresponds to a specific hardware register.

- `val`: This is a pointer to a variable where the read value will be stored after a successful read operation. The type of `val` depends on the function you're using (`readb`, `readw`, `readl`, or `readq`), and it should match the size of the data you're reading.

- `cond`: This is a condition or expression that determines when the read operation should stop polling. The function will repeatedly read from the `addr` until the condition specified by `cond` becomes true. When the condition is true, the function returns.

- `delay_us`: This parameter specifies the delay, in microseconds, between successive read attempts. It controls how often the function checks the condition `cond` after each read. It adds a small delay to the polling loop to reduce CPU load. If `delay_us` is set to 0, there will be no delay between reads.

- `timeout_us` (optional): This parameter sets a timeout, in microseconds, for the polling operation. If the condition `cond` is not met within the specified timeout, the function returns an error. If you don't want to specify a timeout, you can omit this parameter.

- `_atomic` (optional): This parameter indicates whether the read operation should be atomic. An atomic operation ensures that the read is not interrupted by other processes or threads. If `_atomic` is included, it means you want an atomic operation.

The functions `readb_poll`, `readw_poll`, `readl_poll`, and `readq_poll` read from the specified address while repeatedly checking the condition `cond`. If the condition becomes true, the function returns, and the read value is stored in the `val` variable. If a timeout is specified and the condition is not met within that time frame, the function returns an error.

These functions are commonly used in device drivers to read status or control registers of hardware devices while waiting for a specific condition to occur, such as a hardware event or a certain value in a register. They provide a way to poll hardware registers efficiently and handle timeout scenarios when necessary.

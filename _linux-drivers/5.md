# Registering an I2C device: non-DT

## `struct i2c_device_id`:

`struct i2c_device_id` is a data structure used for device driver matching in the context of I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) devices in the Linux kernel. It allows drivers to match and bind to I2C devices based on specific identifiers such as the device's name or compatible string. Here's information about `struct i2c_device_id` and the associated header file:

- **Purpose:** `struct i2c_device_id` is used for I2C device driver matching. It enables drivers to match with specific I2C devices based on characteristics like the device name or compatible string, making it easier to bind drivers to the appropriate devices.

- **Header File:** `<linux/i2c.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.name`: A string representing the name of the I2C device. This is used for matching the driver to the device.
  - `.driver_data`: An integer value associated with the device. It can be used by the driver for device-specific data or configuration.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static const struct i2c_device_id my_i2c_device_id[] = {
    { "my-device-1", 1 },
    { "my-device-2", 2 },
    { "another-device", 3 },
    { /* Sentinel */ },
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c, my_i2c_device_id);
```

In this example, `my_i2c_device_id` is an array of `struct i2c_device_id` that defines a matching table for an I2C driver. It lists different I2C device names along with associated `driver_data` values.

The `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c, ...)` macro generates the necessary code to create a module-level device table, allowing the driver to match with I2C devices based on their names or other characteristics.

The header file `<linux/i2c.h>` contains the definition of `struct i2c_device_id` and related macros for working with I2C device driver matching in the Linux kernel.

## `struct i2c_board_info`:

`struct i2c_board_info` is a data structure used in the Linux kernel to describe I2C devices that should be registered during the kernel's boot process. It is used for defining device information, such as the I2C address, name, and platform-specific data. Here's information about `struct i2c_board_info` and the associated header file:

- **Purpose:** `struct i2c_board_info` is used to describe I2C devices that should be automatically registered during kernel initialization. It is commonly used for static device configuration and registration.

- **Header File:** `<linux/i2c.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.type`: An integer specifying the type or driver identifier for the I2C device.
  - `.addr`: The I2C address of the device.
  - `.flags`: Flags that control the device registration, such as specifying that the device is detectable or specifying platform-specific flags.
  - `.irq`: The interrupt request line associated with the device, if applicable.
  - `.platform_data`: A pointer to platform-specific data that can be associated with the device.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static struct i2c_board_info my_i2c_devices[] = {
    {
        I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-1", 0x42),
        .platform_data = (void *)&my_device_1_data,
    },
    {
        I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-2", 0x50),
        .irq = IRQ_GPIO(4),  // Example GPIO-based IRQ
    },
    { },
};
```

In this example, `my_i2c_devices` is an array of `struct i2c_board_info` that describes I2C devices. Each entry provides information about the device, including its name, I2C address, and optionally, platform-specific data or IRQ configuration.

The header file `<linux/i2c.h>` contains the definition of `struct i2c_board_info` and related macros for working with I2C device information and registration in the Linux kernel.


such structure are mostly defined `I2C_BOARD_INFO()` help macro 

## `I2C_BOARD_INFO()`: 

The `I2C_BOARD_INFO()` macro is used to initialize an instance of `struct i2c_board_info` with some common fields. It simplifies the process of populating the structure with default values for the device name and I2C address. Here's the syntax and usage of `I2C_BOARD_INFO()`:

```c
I2C_BOARD_INFO(device_name, i2c_address)
```

- `device_name`: A string that specifies the name of the I2C device. This is a human-readable identifier for the device.

- `i2c_address`: An integer that represents the I2C address of the device on the I2C bus.

Here's an example of how to use `I2C_BOARD_INFO()`:

```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static struct i2c_board_info my_i2c_devices[] = {
    I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-1", 0x42),  // Initialize with device name and I2C address
    I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-2", 0x50),  // Another device
    { },
};
```

In this example, `my_i2c_devices` is an array of `struct i2c_board_info` that describes I2C devices. The `I2C_BOARD_INFO()` macro is used to initialize each entry with a device name and I2C address. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable by providing default values for these common fields.

The `I2C_BOARD_INFO()` macro is particularly useful when you have multiple I2C devices to describe, and it helps reduce repetitive code for initializing these common fields.


## `i2c_register_board_info()`:

`i2c_register_board_info()` is a function used in the Linux kernel to register a list of I2C devices with the I2C core during the system's boot process. This function allows you to provide information about I2C devices that should be automatically detected and initialized by the kernel. Here's how `i2c_register_board_info()` works and how to use it:

- **Purpose:** `i2c_register_board_info()` is used to specify information about I2C devices that should be probed and registered by the kernel during initialization. It is commonly used for devices that are statically defined and not probed dynamically.

- **Header File:** `<linux/i2c.h>`

- **Function Signature:**
  ```c
  int i2c_register_board_info(int busnum, struct i2c_board_info const *info, unsigned n);
  ```

  - `busnum`: The number of the I2C bus to register the devices on.
  - `info`: A pointer to an array of `struct i2c_board_info` that describes the I2C devices.
  - `n`: The number of entries in the `info` array.

- **Return Value:** Returns 0 on success or a negative error code on failure.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static struct i2c_board_info my_i2c_devices[] = {
    {
        I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-1", 0x42),
        .platform_data = (void *)&my_device_1_data,
    },
    {
        I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-2", 0x50),
        .irq = IRQ_GPIO(4),  // Example GPIO-based IRQ
    },
    { },
};

static int __init my_i2c_init(void) {
    int ret;

    // Register the I2C devices
    ret = i2c_register_board_info(0, my_i2c_devices, ARRAY_SIZE(my_i2c_devices));
    if (ret < 0) {
        printk(KERN_ERR "Failed to register I2C devices: %d\n", ret);
        return ret;
    }

    // Other initialization code...

    return 0;
}
module_init(my_i2c_init);
```

In this example, `my_i2c_init` is a module initialization function that registers I2C devices using `i2c_register_board_info()`. The `my_i2c_devices` array contains descriptions of the I2C devices to be registered. After successful registration, the kernel will attempt to probe and initialize these devices during boot.

It's important to note that `i2c_register_board_info()` is typically used for devices that are statically defined, and it's not suitable for dynamic device probing. For dynamically detectable devices, other mechanisms such as device tree-based probing are commonly used.


# Registering an I2C device, in the DT

## `struct i2c_client` 
`struct i2c_client` is a data structure used in the Linux kernel to represent an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) device that the kernel has detected and is managing. It contains information about the I2C device and is used by device drivers to interact with the hardware. Here's an explanation of `struct i2c_client`, along with an example and the associated header file:

- **Purpose:** `struct i2c_client` is used to represent an I2C device and store information about it, such as its address, name, and platform-specific data. It allows device drivers to interact with the I2C device and perform operations like reading and writing data.

- **Header File:** `<linux/i2c.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.adapter`: A pointer to the I2C bus adapter that the device is connected to. This adapter is responsible for communication between the CPU and the I2C device.
  - `.addr`: The 7-bit I2C address of the device.
  - `.name`: A string specifying the name of the I2C device.
  - `.dev`: A reference to the `struct device` associated with the I2C device. This provides access to the device's properties and allows for sysfs interaction.
  - `.driver`: A pointer to the I2C driver that is bound to this device, if any.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

struct i2c_client *my_i2c_client;

static int my_i2c_probe(struct i2c_client *client, const struct i2c_device_id *id) {
    // Access and interact with the I2C device using 'client'
    printk(KERN_INFO "Detected I2C device: %s at address 0x%02X\n", client->name, client->addr);
    return 0;
}

static const struct i2c_device_id my_i2c_id[] = {
    { "my-i2c-device", 0 },  // Example I2C device ID
    { }
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c, my_i2c_id);

static struct i2c_driver my_i2c_driver = {
    .probe = my_i2c_probe,
    .id_table = my_i2c_id,
    .driver = {
        .name = "my-i2c-driver",
        .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    },
};

static int __init my_i2c_init(void) {
    int ret;

    // Register the I2C driver
    ret = i2c_add_driver(&my_i2c_driver);
    if (ret < 0) {
        printk(KERN_ERR "Failed to register I2C driver: %d\n", ret);
        return ret;
    }

    return 0;
}
module_init(my_i2c_init);

static void __exit my_i2c_exit(void) {
    // Unregister the I2C driver
    i2c_del_driver(&my_i2c_driver);
}
module_exit(my_i2c_exit);
```

In this example, `struct i2c_client` is used in the `my_i2c_probe` function to interact with the I2C device that matches the driver. The `my_i2c_probe` function receives a pointer to the `i2c_client` representing the detected device. It can access attributes like `name` and `addr` to identify and work with the device.

The associated header file for `struct i2c_client` is `<linux/i2c.h>`. This header file provides the structure definition and related functions for working with I2C devices and drivers in the Linux kernel.

## `struct device` 

`struct device` is a fundamental data structure in the Linux kernel that represents and manages a hardware device or device-like entity within the kernel's device model. It plays a central role in device management and interaction between device drivers and the kernel. Here's an explanation of `struct device`:

- **Purpose:** `struct device` is used to represent hardware devices, buses, and various other entities within the Linux kernel. It abstracts and encapsulates device-specific information and provides a common interface for device drivers to interact with the kernel.

- **Header File:** `<linux/device.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.parent`: A pointer to the parent device in the device hierarchy. It represents the device to which this device is connected.
  - `.bus`: A pointer to the bus type to which the device belongs. It specifies the type of bus (e.g., I2C, PCI) that the device is attached to.
  - `.init_name`: A string that represents the device's name. This is used to identify the device in sysfs and user-space.
  - `.of_node`: A pointer to the Device Tree node associated with the device, if applicable. It is used for Device Tree-based device probing.
  - `.driver`: A pointer to the device driver bound to this device, if any.
  - `.type`: An identifier specifying the type of the device.
  - `.groups`: An array of attribute groups that define sysfs attributes for the device. These attributes allow user-space interaction and configuration of the device.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/device.h>

struct device *my_device;

static int __init my_device_init(void) {
    // Create a device
    my_device = device_create(my_class, NULL, MKDEV(0, 0), NULL, "my_device");
    if (IS_ERR(my_device)) {
        printk(KERN_ERR "Failed to create device: %ld\n", PTR_ERR(my_device));
        return PTR_ERR(my_device);
    }

    return 0;
}
module_init(my_device_init);

static void __exit my_device_exit(void) {
    // Destroy the device
    device_destroy(my_class, MKDEV(0, 0));
}
module_exit(my_device_exit);
```

In this example, `struct device` is used to create and manage a device named "my_device." The `device_create()` function is used to create the device, and `device_destroy()` is used to destroy it. The device is associated with a device class (`my_class`), which manages devices of the same type.

The associated header file for `struct device` is `<linux/device.h>`. This header file provides the structure definition and related functions for working with devices and the device model in the Linux kernel.


## `->probe()`

The `->probe()` function is a callback function defined within a device driver structure in the Linux kernel. It is used to initialize and probe a specific device that matches the driver. The `->probe()` function is called by the kernel when a device is detected that matches the driver's criteria. Here's an explanation of `->probe()` and its purpose:

- **Purpose:** The `->probe()` function is responsible for initializing and configuring a specific device that matches the driver. It typically performs the following tasks:
  - Hardware initialization: Setting up hardware resources and registers.
  - Device-specific configuration: Configuring the device for its intended operation.
  - Allocation of resources: Allocating memory, IRQs, and other resources if needed.
  - Registration with the kernel: Registering the device with the kernel's device model.

- **Usage:** The `->probe()` function is part of the driver structure (e.g., `struct platform_driver`, `struct i2c_driver`) and is defined by the driver developer. When the kernel detects a device that matches the driver (e.g., through device tree matching, platform data, or other mechanisms), it calls the `->probe()` function for that device's driver.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  static int my_device_probe(struct platform_device *pdev) {
      // Initialize and configure the device
      // Allocate resources, if needed
      // Register the device with the kernel

      return 0; // Return 0 on success, or an error code on failure
  }

  static struct platform_driver my_driver = {
      .probe = my_device_probe,
      .driver = {
          .name = "my-device",
          .owner = THIS_MODULE,
      },
  };
  ```

In this example, `my_device_probe` is the `->probe()` function for a platform driver. It initializes and configures the device represented by `pdev` (a `struct platform_device`). The driver structure `my_driver` associates this probe function with the driver.

When the kernel detects a platform device that matches the driver, it calls `my_device_probe(pdev)` to initialize and configure that specific device. The probe function returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.

The specific driver structure (`struct platform_driver`, `struct i2c_driver`, etc.) and the associated callback function (e.g., `->probe()`) depend on the type of driver and the kernel subsystem it belongs to.


## `->remove()`

The `->remove()` function is a callback function defined within a device driver structure in the Linux kernel. It is used to handle the removal and cleanup of a specific device when it is being unplugged or removed from the system. The `->remove()` function is called by the kernel when a device is being removed or when the driver is being unloaded. Here's an explanation of `->remove()` and its purpose:

- **Purpose:** The `->remove()` function is responsible for cleaning up resources, releasing memory, and performing any necessary shutdown procedures for a device that is being removed from the system. It typically performs the following tasks:
  - Resource deallocation: Releasing resources such as memory, IRQs, and other allocated resources.
  - Device-specific cleanup: Shutting down the device and preparing it for removal.
  - Deregistration: Removing the device from the kernel's device model.

- **Usage:** The `->remove()` function is part of the driver structure (e.g., `struct platform_driver`, `struct i2c_driver`) and is defined by the driver developer. When a device is being removed or when the driver module is being unloaded, the kernel calls the `->remove()` function for that device's driver.

- **Example:**
  ```c
  static int my_device_remove(struct platform_device *pdev) {
      // Perform cleanup and shutdown procedures for the device
      // Deallocate resources and unregister from the kernel

      return 0; // Return 0 on success, or an error code on failure
  }

  static struct platform_driver my_driver = {
      .probe = my_device_probe,
      .remove = my_device_remove, // Assign the remove function
      .driver = {
          .name = "my-device",
          .owner = THIS_MODULE,
      },
  };
  ```

In this example, `my_device_remove` is the `->remove()` function for a platform driver. It is responsible for cleaning up and shutting down the device represented by `pdev` (a `struct platform_device`) when it is being removed from the system. The driver structure `my_driver` associates this remove function with the driver.

When the kernel detects that a platform device is being removed or when the driver module is being unloaded, it calls `my_device_remove(pdev)` to perform the necessary cleanup procedures for that specific device. The remove function returns 0 on success or an error code on failure.

The specific driver structure (`struct platform_driver`, `struct i2c_driver`, etc.) and the associated callback function (e.g., `->remove()`) depend on the type of driver and the kernel subsystem it belongs to.



# Communicating with the I2C device: message transfer

## `struct i2c_adapter`

`struct i2c_adapter` is a data structure in the Linux kernel that represents an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus or adapter. It provides a way for the kernel to manage I2C buses and devices connected to those buses. This structure encapsulates information about the I2C bus, including its name, bus number, and capabilities. Here's an explanation of `struct i2c_adapter`:

- **Purpose:** `struct i2c_adapter` is used to represent and manage I2C buses in the Linux kernel. An I2C bus can have multiple devices connected to it, and this structure keeps track of information related to the bus itself.

- **Header File:** `<linux/i2c.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.name`: A string representing the name of the I2C bus or adapter. This is a human-readable identifier for the bus.
  - `.owner`: A pointer to the module that owns the bus adapter. It helps prevent the adapter from being unloaded while in use.
  - `.id`: A unique identifier for the I2C bus, typically assigned by the kernel.
  - `.algo`: A pointer to the I2C algorithm (such as the bit-banging algorithm) used by the bus.
  - `.algo_data`: A pointer to private data used by the I2C algorithm.
  - `.timeout`: The maximum time in milliseconds to wait for I2C transactions to complete on the bus.
  - `.nr`: The bus number, which uniquely identifies the I2C bus.
  - `.class`: A pointer to the I2C class (struct i2c_adapter_class) associated with the bus.
  - `.dev`: A reference to the parent device, if applicable. This links the adapter to its parent device in the device hierarchy.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static struct i2c_adapter my_i2c_adapter = {
    .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    .name = "my_i2c_bus",
};
```

In this example, `my_i2c_adapter` is an instance of `struct i2c_adapter` representing an I2C bus with the name "my_i2c_bus." The adapter is associated with the current kernel module (specified by `THIS_MODULE`) as its owner. The actual initialization and setup of I2C adapters depend on the hardware and the bus type (e.g., platform I2C, SMBus, etc.).

The header file `<linux/i2c.h>` contains the definition of `struct i2c_adapter` and related functions for working with I2C buses and adapters in the Linux kernel.


 In the Linux kernel, you can obtain a pointer to the `struct i2c_adapter` associated with an `struct i2c_client` by using the `client->adapter` member. This allows you to access information about the I2C bus that the client device is connected to. Here's how you can use it:

```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static int my_device_probe(struct i2c_client *client, const struct i2c_device_id *id) {
    // Access the I2C bus adapter associated with the client
    struct i2c_adapter *adapter = client->adapter;

    // Access information about the adapter
    printk(KERN_INFO "I2C adapter name: %s\n", adapter->name);
    printk(KERN_INFO "I2C adapter bus number: %d\n", adapter->nr);

    // Access other attributes of the adapter as needed

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, within the `my_device_probe` function, we use `client->adapter` to obtain a pointer to the `struct i2c_adapter` associated with the `i2c_client` (device) represented by `client`. This allows us to access information about the I2C bus, such as its name and bus number.

This can be useful when a device driver needs to perform operations or obtain information related to the I2C bus, especially when multiple devices are connected to the same bus, and you want to access bus-level properties.


##  `struct i2c_msg`
`struct i2c_msg` is a data structure in the Linux kernel that represents a message or transaction to be sent or received on an I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus. It is commonly used in I2C device drivers to define read and write operations for communication with I2C devices. Here's an explanation of `struct i2c_msg`:

- **Purpose:** `struct i2c_msg` is used to specify the details of an I2C message or transaction, including the I2C address, data buffer, data length, and the direction of the transaction (read or write).

- **Header File:** `<linux/i2c.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.addr`: The 7-bit I2C address of the target device with which the communication is performed.
  - `.flags`: A set of flags that indicate the direction and characteristics of the I2C transaction. Common flags include `I2C_M_RD` (read) and `I2C_M_WR` (write).
  - `.len`: The length of the data buffer in bytes.
  - `.buf`: A pointer to the data buffer containing the data to be sent (for write operations) or the buffer to receive data (for read operations).

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

// Define an I2C message for writing data to an I2C device
static struct i2c_msg write_msg = {
    .addr = 0x50,                // I2C device address
    .flags = 0,                  // Flags for write operation
    .len = 3,                    // Length of data to write
    .buf = (unsigned char[]){0x01, 0x23, 0x45},  // Data to write
};

// Define an I2C message for reading data from an I2C device
static struct i2c_msg read_msg = {
    .addr = 0x50,                // I2C device address
    .flags = I2C_M_RD,           // Flags for read operation
    .len = 4,                    // Length of data to read
    .buf = (unsigned char[4]){},  // Data buffer to receive read data
};
```

In this example, two `struct i2c_msg` instances, `write_msg` and `read_msg`, are defined. `write_msg` represents an I2C write operation, where data is sent to the I2C device at address 0x50, and `read_msg` represents an I2C read operation, where data is read from the same device.

These structures are used when performing I2C transactions using functions like `i2c_transfer()`. The `flags` field specifies the direction of the transaction, and the `buf` field points to the data buffer for sending or receiving data.


#  `System Management Bus (SMBus)`

The `System Management Bus (SMBus)` is a subset of the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) bus protocol. SMBus is essentially a standardized version of I2C designed for system management and control purposes. It defines a set of rules and protocols for communication between various hardware components within a computer or embedded system.

The Linux kernel provides support for SMBus communication through a set of functions and data structures. Some common SMBus calls in the Linux kernel include:

1. `i2c_smbus_write_byte_data()`:
   - Purpose: Writes a byte of data to a specific register on an SMBus device.
   - Usage: Used when you need to send a single byte of data to configure or control an SMBus device.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int result = i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(client, register_address, data);
     ```

2. `i2c_smbus_read_byte_data()`:
   - Purpose: Reads a byte of data from a specific register on an SMBus device.
   - Usage: Used when you want to read a byte of data from a specific register of an SMBus device.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int data = i2c_smbus_read_byte_data(client, register_address);
     ```

3. `i2c_smbus_write_word_data()`:
   - Purpose: Writes a 16-bit word of data to a specific register on an SMBus device.
   - Usage: Used for sending 16-bit data to an SMBus device for configuration or control.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int result = i2c_smbus_write_word_data(client, register_address, data);
     ```

4. `i2c_smbus_read_word_data()`:
   - Purpose: Reads a 16-bit word of data from a specific register on an SMBus device.
   - Usage: Used for reading 16-bit data from a specific register of an SMBus device.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int data = i2c_smbus_read_word_data(client, register_address);
     ```

5. `i2c_smbus_write_block_data()`:
   - Purpose: Writes a block of data to a specific register on an SMBus device.
   - Usage: Used for sending a block of data to an SMBus device.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int result = i2c_smbus_write_block_data(client, register_address, length, data);
     ```

6. `i2c_smbus_read_block_data()`:
   - Purpose: Reads a block of data from a specific register on an SMBus device.
   - Usage: Used for reading a block of data from an SMBus device.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int result = i2c_smbus_read_block_data(client, register_address, length, data);
     ```


This subsystem provides a common interface for I2C and SMBus communication.

The relationship between SMBus and I2C in these examples is as follows:

1. **I2C Hardware:** The I2C hardware provides the physical layer for communication. It consists of the I2C bus lines (SCL and SDA) and hardware-level signaling.

2. **Linux I2C Subsystem:** The Linux kernel includes an I2C subsystem that provides a set of functions and data structures for working with I2C and SMBus devices. This subsystem abstracts the low-level hardware details and provides a standardized interface for device drivers.

3. **SMBus Functions:** The functions like `i2c_smbus_write_byte_data()` and `i2c_smbus_read_byte_data()` are part of the I2C subsystem but are specifically designed to handle SMBus transactions. SMBus is a standardized protocol that operates over the I2C physical layer, and these functions provide an API for interacting with SMBus-compliant devices.

4. **Device Drivers:** Device drivers for SMBus/I2C devices use these functions to perform read and write operations on the devices. These drivers are responsible for configuring and controlling SMBus/I2C devices using the Linux I2C subsystem.

So, in summary, the Linux I2C subsystem serves as a common platform for both I2C and SMBus communication. SMBus-specific functions within this subsystem allow device drivers to interact with SMBus-compliant devices while leveraging the I2C hardware and protocol. This abstraction simplifies the development of device drivers for system management and control tasks.

## Note 

You are correct. SMBus adapters in Linux cannot send raw I2C commands as they are designed to adhere to the SMBus protocol, which is a subset of the I2C protocol. In an SMBus transaction, the core SMBus layer in Linux crafts SMBus-like commands based on the higher-level functions provided by the user or the device driver. These commands include read and write operations that conform to the SMBus specifications.

The key differences between raw I2C commands and SMBus transactions are as follows:

1. **SMBus Protocol:** SMBus is a well-defined protocol with specific command codes and rules for communication. It includes commands for tasks such as reading and writing bytes, words, and block data, as well as procedures for sending and receiving data.

2. **Command-Level Abstraction:** When using SMBus adapters in Linux, device drivers and applications typically work at the level of SMBus commands, not raw I2C data. The core SMBus layer translates these commands into the appropriate I2C transactions and handles protocol-specific details.

3. **SMBus Compliance:** SMBus adapters ensure compliance with SMBus specifications, which may include timing requirements, arbitration rules, and specific command behaviors. This ensures compatibility with SMBus-compliant devices.

4. **Safety and Compatibility:** By using SMBus commands rather than raw I2C commands, Linux ensures that SMBus transactions are safe and compatible with a wide range of SMBus-compliant hardware.

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the difference:

- **Raw I2C Command (Not Supported by SMBus Adapter):**
  ```c
  // Sending a raw I2C write command
  i2c_master_send(client, raw_data, data_length);
  ```

- **SMBus Transaction (Supported by SMBus Adapter):**
  ```c
  // Sending an SMBus write byte data command
  i2c_smbus_write_byte_data(client, register_address, data);
  ```

In the first example, a raw I2C write command is used, which is not compliant with the SMBus protocol. In the second example, an SMBus-specific function is used to send an SMBus write byte data command, ensuring that the transaction adheres to the SMBus protocol.

Overall, SMBus adapters in Linux are designed to facilitate communication with SMBus-compliant devices by providing a higher-level, protocol-aware interface.


# I2C functionality

## `i2c_check_functionality()`

The `i2c_check_functionality()` function is a utility function available in the Linux kernel's I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) subsystem. It is used to check the functionality and capabilities of an I2C bus adapter by querying whether specific features are supported by the hardware and the associated driver. This function is particularly useful for device drivers that need to ensure that certain I2C features or functionality are available before proceeding with operations.

Here's a brief explanation of `i2c_check_functionality()`:

- **Purpose:** The primary purpose of `i2c_check_functionality()` is to check whether specific functionality is supported by an I2C bus and its associated driver. It allows drivers to determine whether certain features can be relied upon.

- **Parameters:** The function typically takes a pointer to an `struct i2c_adapter` (representing the I2C bus) as its argument.

- **Return Value:** The function returns a bitmask that indicates the supported functionality. The bitmask consists of flags that can be checked to determine which features are available.

- **Example Usage:**
  ```c
  struct i2c_adapter *adapter = i2c_get_adapter(bus_number);
  if (adapter) {
      unsigned int functionality = i2c_check_functionality(adapter, I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BYTE);
      if (functionality & I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BYTE) {
          // SMBus read byte functionality is supported
          // Perform operations that rely on this functionality
      }
      i2c_put_adapter(adapter); // Release the adapter when done
  }
  ```

In this example:
- We obtain an I2C adapter using `i2c_get_adapter()` with the desired bus number.
- We call `i2c_check_functionality()` to check whether the I2C adapter supports a specific feature, in this case, `I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BYTE` (SMBus read byte functionality).
- If the functionality is supported (indicated by the bitmask), we can perform operations that rely on this feature.
- Finally, we release the I2C adapter using `i2c_put_adapter()` when we're done with it.

The `i2c_check_functionality()` function allows I2C device drivers to make informed decisions based on the capabilities of the underlying I2C hardware and driver, ensuring compatibility and reliable operation. It's particularly valuable when dealing with a variety of I2C adapters and devices that may have different levels of support for I2C features.

# Common APIs used by the platform drivers 
Platform drivers in Linux interact with various hardware and system resources through a set of APIs and functions. Here are some commonly used APIs by platform drivers, along with examples:

1. **`platform_driver_register()` and `platform_driver_unregister()`:**
   - These functions are used to register and unregister a platform driver, respectively.
   - Example (registration):
     ```c
     static struct platform_driver my_platform_driver = {
         .probe = my_probe_function,
         .remove = my_remove_function,
         .driver = {
             .name = "my-device",
             .owner = THIS_MODULE,
         },
     };

     module_platform_driver(my_platform_driver);
     ```

2. **`platform_get_resource()`:**
   - Used to access hardware resources defined in the Device Tree.
   - Example:
     ```c
     struct resource *res;
     res = platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_MEM, 0);
     ```

3. **`ioremap()` and `iounmap()`:**
   - These functions are used to map and unmap memory regions for memory-mapped I/O (MMIO) operations.
   - Example (mapping):
     ```c
     void __iomem *base;
     base = ioremap(res->start, PAGE_SIZE);
     ```

4. **`platform_get_irq()`:**
   - Retrieves the IRQ number associated with the platform device for interrupt handling.
   - Example:
     ```c
     int irq;
     irq = platform_get_irq(pdev, 0);
     ```

5. **`clk_get()` and `clk_put()`:**
   - Used for clock management, including obtaining and releasing clock references.
   - Example (obtaining a clock):
     ```c
     struct clk *my_clk;
     my_clk = clk_get(&pdev->dev, "my-clock");
     ```

6. **`gpio_request()` and `gpio_free()`:**
   - Used for GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pin management.
   - Example (requesting a GPIO pin):
     ```c
     int gpio_pin = 17;  // GPIO pin number
     if (gpio_request(gpio_pin, "my_gpio_pin") == 0) {
         // GPIO pin is now reserved
     }
     ```

7. **`dma_request_channel()` and `dma_release_channel()`:**
   - Used to request and release DMA (Direct Memory Access) channels.
   - Example (requesting a DMA channel):
     ```c
     struct dma_chan *my_dma_channel;
     my_dma_channel = dma_request_channel(DMA_MEMCPY, NULL, NULL);
     ```

8. **`devm_kzalloc()` and `devm_kfree()`:**
   - Used for memory allocation and deallocation with automatic resource management (memory is automatically freed when the device is removed).
   - Example (allocating memory):
     ```c
     struct my_data *data;
     data = devm_kzalloc(&pdev->dev, sizeof(struct my_data), GFP_KERNEL);
     ```

These are some of the key APIs commonly used by platform drivers in Linux. Depending on the specific hardware and requirements, drivers may use additional APIs for tasks like setting up interrupt handlers, interacting with hardware-specific registers, managing power, and more. The examples provided demonstrate the basic usage of these functions in the context of a platform driver.

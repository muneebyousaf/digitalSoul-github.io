# Common platform driver data structures 
Device drivers in Linux often use common data structures to interact with the kernel, hardware, and user-space components. Here are some common data structures used by drivers, along with examples:

1. **`struct platform_driver` and `struct platform_device`:**
   - Used for platform-specific drivers and devices.
   - Example (driver and device definition):
     ```c
     static struct platform_driver my_platform_driver = {
         .probe = my_probe_function,
         .remove = my_remove_function,
         .driver = {
             .name = "my-device",
             .owner = THIS_MODULE,
         },
     };

     static struct platform_device my_platform_device = {
         .name = "my-device",
         .id = -1,
         .num_resources = 0,
     };
     ```
     

Let's explore these data structures in detail:

### struct platform_driver:

`struct platform_driver` is a data structure used by platform-specific drivers in Linux. It allows the driver to define its operations and associate itself with compatible platform devices. Here are some of its key fields:

- `.probe`: A function pointer to the probe function that gets called when a compatible platform device is found. This function initializes and configures the device and its resources.

- `.remove`: A function pointer to the remove function, which is called when the driver is being unloaded or the device is being removed. It performs cleanup and resource release.

- `.driver.name`: A string that specifies the name of the driver. This name is used for matching platform devices with compatible drivers.

- `.driver.of_match_table`: A pointer to a matching table that allows the driver to match with compatible devices listed in the Device Tree. It's used in conjunction with the `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, ...)` macro.

- `.driver.owner`: A pointer to the module that owns the driver. This helps in managing the driver's reference count.

- `.id_table`: An optional pointer to an identifier table for device-specific data. It's commonly used for device-specific initialization and configuration.

Here's an example of defining a `struct platform_driver`:

```c
static struct platform_driver my_platform_driver = {
    .probe = my_probe_function,
    .remove = my_remove_function,
    .driver = {
        .name = "my-device",
        .of_match_table = of_match_ptr(my_of_match),
        .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    },
};
```

### struct platform_device:

`struct platform_device` is a data structure representing a platform-specific device. It's typically defined by the platform-specific code or the Device Tree and is used to associate a device with its corresponding driver. Here are some key fields:

- `.name`: A string that specifies the name of the platform device. This name is used for matching with compatible drivers.

- `.id`: An identifier for the device. It can be used to distinguish multiple devices of the same type.

- `.num_resources`: The number of resources (e.g., memory regions, IRQs) associated with the device.

- `.resource`: An array of resource structures (usually `struct resource`) that define the hardware resources required by the device.

Here's an example of defining a `struct platform_device`:

```c
static struct platform_device my_platform_device = {
    .name = "my-device",
    .id = -1,  // Default identifier
    .num_resources = ARRAY_SIZE(my_resources),
    .resource = my_resources,
};
```

In this example, `my_platform_device` represents a platform device named "my-device" with associated resources defined in the `my_resources` array.

These data structures, along with functions and macros, provide a standardized way for platform-specific drivers to interact with platform devices, ensuring proper device detection, initialization, and removal in the Linux kernel.

2. **`struct resource`:**
   - Represents hardware resources, such as memory regions and IRQs.
   - Example (resource definition):
     ```c
     static struct resource my_resource = {
         .start = 0x1000,
         .end = 0x1FFF,
         .flags = IORESOURCE_MEM,
     };
     ```

3. **`struct clk` and `struct clk_hw`:**
   - Used for clock management.
   - Example (clock definition):
     ```c
     struct clk *my_clk;
     my_clk = clk_get(&pdev->dev, "my-clock");
     ```
     `struct clk` and `struct clk_hw` are data structures used in the Linux kernel for clock management and abstraction. They play a crucial role in handling clock sources and managing clock operations for various hardware components and subsystems.

Let's explore each of these structures in detail:

### struct clk:

`struct clk` represents a clock source in the Linux kernel. Clocks are essential for managing the timing and synchronization of hardware components. This structure provides a uniform interface for clock operations, regardless of the specific hardware platform. Here are some key fields and functions associated with `struct clk`:

- `.name`: A string that specifies the name of the clock source.

- `.ops`: A pointer to a clock operations structure (`struct clk_ops`) that defines functions for enabling, disabling, and controlling the clock.

- `.parent`: A pointer to the parent clock source, indicating the clock from which the current clock derives its frequency.

- `.rate`: The current clock rate in Hz.

- `.flags`: Flags that describe characteristics of the clock, such as being critical or always enabled.

- Clock operations functions (e.g., `.enable()`, `.disable()`, `.set_rate()`) are defined in the associated `struct clk_ops`.

Example usage of `struct clk`:

```c
struct clk *my_clk;
my_clk = clk_get(&pdev->dev, "my-clock");
if (IS_ERR(my_clk)) {
    pr_err("Failed to get my-clock\n");
    // Handle the error
}
```

In this example, `my_clk` represents a clock source named "my-clock," and it can be used to control the clock's state and frequency.

### struct clk_hw:

`struct clk_hw` is used to represent a clock hardware abstraction. It encapsulates the hardware-specific details of a clock source and provides a common interface for clock operations. `struct clk_hw` is often used to define clocks that are part of a clock controller or multiplexer. Key attributes and functions include:

- `.hw`: A pointer to the underlying clock hardware.

- `.get_name()`: A function to retrieve the clock's name.

- `.get_flags()`: A function to retrieve clock flags (e.g., critical, always enabled).

- `.get_parent()`: A function to retrieve the parent clock source.

- `.recalc_rate()`: A function to calculate the clock rate based on the hardware configuration.

- `.round_rate()`: A function to round a requested rate to a supported rate.

Example usage of `struct clk_hw`:

```c
struct clk_hw *my_clk_hw;
my_clk_hw = clk_hw_get_parent_by_index(hw, 0);
if (IS_ERR(my_clk_hw)) {
    pr_err("Failed to get parent clock\n");
    // Handle the error
}
```

In this example, `my_clk_hw` represents a clock hardware abstraction that can be used to query and manipulate clock-related information for a specific clock.

These data structures, along with associated functions, provide a standardized and platform-independent way to manage clocks in the Linux kernel, making it easier for device drivers to work with various hardware configurations.

4. **`struct gpio_desc` and `struct gpio_chip`:**
   - Used for GPIO pin management.
   - Example (GPIO configuration):
     ```c
     struct gpio_desc *my_gpio;
     my_gpio = gpiod_get(&pdev->dev, "my-gpio", GPIOD_OUT_LOW);
     ```
     `struct gpio_desc` and `struct gpio_chip` are data structures used in the Linux kernel for managing GPIO (General-Purpose Input/Output) pins. GPIO pins are commonly used for interfacing with external devices, sensors, and controlling various hardware components.

Let's explore each of these structures in detail:

### struct gpio_desc:

`struct gpio_desc` represents a GPIO pin descriptor in the Linux kernel. It provides a unified way to represent and interact with individual GPIO pins. Here are some key attributes and functions associated with `struct gpio_desc`:

- `.gpiod`: A pointer to a `struct gpio_descs` structure that contains the GPIO descriptor.

- `.desc`: A pointer to the underlying `struct gpio_desc` that represents the GPIO pin.

- `.label`: A string describing the GPIO pin.

- `.flags`: Flags that describe the GPIO pin's configuration (e.g., input, output, active low, active high).

- Functions like `gpiod_get()` and `gpiod_set_value()` are used to interact with GPIO pins using `struct gpio_desc`.

Example usage of `struct gpio_desc`:

```c
struct gpio_desc *my_gpio;
my_gpio = gpiod_get(&pdev->dev, "my-gpio", GPIOD_OUT_LOW);
if (IS_ERR(my_gpio)) {
    pr_err("Failed to get GPIO pin\n");
    // Handle the error
}
```

In this example, `my_gpio` represents a GPIO pin named "my-gpio" configured as an output and initially set to a low state.

### struct gpio_chip:

`struct gpio_chip` represents a GPIO controller or a collection of GPIO pins within the Linux kernel. It provides an interface for controlling multiple GPIO pins that are part of the same controller. Here are some key attributes and functions associated with `struct gpio_chip`:

- `.base`: The base GPIO number for the GPIO controller. This defines the GPIO pin numbering scheme.

- `.ngpio`: The total number of GPIO pins provided by the GPIO controller.

- `.label`: A string describing the GPIO controller.

- Functions like `.request()` and `.free()` are used for requesting and releasing GPIO pins from the controller.

- Functions like `.get()` and `.set()` are used to read and write the state of GPIO pins within the controller.

Example usage of `struct gpio_chip`:

```c
struct gpio_chip my_gpio_chip = {
    .label = "my-gpio-controller",
    .base = GPIO_MY_BASE,
    .ngpio = 16,  // Total number of GPIO pins
    .request = my_gpio_request,
    .free = my_gpio_free,
    .get = my_gpio_get,
    .set = my_gpio_set,
};
```

In this example, `my_gpio_chip` represents a GPIO controller labeled "my-gpio-controller" with 16 GPIO pins starting from `GPIO_MY_BASE`. The functions `my_gpio_request`, `my_gpio_free`, `my_gpio_get`, and `my_gpio_set` are callbacks defined by the driver to interact with the GPIO controller.

These data structures, along with associated functions and callbacks, provide a standardized way to manage and control GPIO pins in the Linux kernel, making it easier for device drivers to work with GPIOs across various hardware platforms.

5. **`struct dma_chan` and `struct dma_device`:**
   - Used for DMA (Direct Memory Access) channel management.
   - Example (DMA channel request):
     ```c
     struct dma_chan *my_dma_channel;
     my_dma_channel = dma_request_channel(DMA_MEMCPY, NULL, NULL);
     ```

`struct dma_chan` and `struct dma_device` are data structures used in the Linux kernel for managing Direct Memory Access (DMA) operations. These structures are part of the DMA framework and facilitate efficient data transfers between memory and I/O devices. Below, I'll describe these structures and mention the associated header files.

### struct dma_chan:

- **Description:** `struct dma_chan` represents a DMA channel, which is a logical entity responsible for managing data transfers between a peripheral device and memory. Each DMA channel has specific capabilities and is typically associated with a specific hardware DMA controller.

- **Header File:** `include/linux/dmaengine.h`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.device`: A pointer to the DMA device (`struct dma_device`) associated with the channel.
  - `.chan_id`: A unique identifier for the channel.
  - `.cookie`: An opaque identifier for the current transaction.
  - `.device_node`: A pointer to the device node in the Device Tree, if applicable.
  - Various function pointers for initializing, submitting, and managing DMA transactions.

Example usage:
```c
struct dma_chan *my_dma_channel;
my_dma_channel = dma_request_slave_channel(&pdev->dev, "my-dma-channel");
if (IS_ERR(my_dma_channel)) {
    pr_err("Failed to request DMA channel\n");
    // Handle the error
}
```

In this example, `my_dma_channel` represents a DMA channel named "my-dma-channel" associated with a device (`pdev->dev`). It is used for performing DMA transfers.

### struct dma_device:

- **Description:** `struct dma_device` represents a DMA controller or engine, which manages one or more DMA channels. It provides the interface for requesting and releasing DMA channels and configuring DMA operations.

my_dma_controller = dma_request_chan(&pdev->dev, "my-dma-controller");
if (IS_ERR(my_dma_controller)) {
    pr_err("Failed to request DMA controller\n");
    // Handle the error
}
```

In this example, `my_dma_controller` represents a DMA controller named "my-dma-controller" associated with a parent device (`pdev->dev`). It manages one or more DMA channels for data transfers.

These data structures, along with the associated header file (`dmaengine.h`), are part of the Linux DMA framework, which provides a standardized interface for managing DMA operations in device drivers.
6. **`struct file_operations` and `struct file`:**
   - Used for file operations and file-related data.
   - Example (file operations):
     ```c
     static const struct file_operations my_fops = {
         .open = my_open,
         .release = my_release,
         .read = my_read,
         .write = my_write,
     };
     ```
`struct file_operations` and `struct file` are fundamental data structures used in the Linux kernel for file handling and represent the operations and state of an opened file. Here, I'll describe these structures and mention their associated header files:

### struct file_operations:

- **Description:** `struct file_operations` represents a set of file operations or methods that define how a driver or filesystem interacts with an open file. These methods include functions for opening, closing, reading, writing, seeking, and performing various file-related operations.

- **Header File:** `include/linux/fs.h`

- **Key Attributes:** A collection of function pointers that define file-related operations, such as `.open`, `.read`, `.write`, `.release`, `.llseek`, and more.

Example usage (defining `struct file_operations`):
```c
static const struct file_operations my_fops = {
    .owner = THIS_MODULE,
    .open = my_open,
    .release = my_release,
    .read = my_read,
    .write = my_write,
};
```

In this example, `my_fops` defines a set of file operations for a driver. These functions (e.g., `my_open`, `my_release`, `my_read`, `my_write`) are callback functions implemented by the driver to handle file-related operations.

### struct file:

- **Description:** `struct file` represents an open file descriptor in the Linux kernel. It maintains information about an open file, such as its position, access mode, and a reference to the associated `struct file_operations` for handling operations on the file.

- **Header File:** `include/linux/fs.h`

- **Key Attributes:** Various fields that store information about the open file, including `.f_path` (path to the file), `.f_inode` (inode information), `.f_flags` (file access flags), `.f_pos` (current file position), and more.

Example usage (working with `struct file`):
```c
struct file *my_file;
my_file = filp_open("/path/to/myfile", O_RDWR, 0);
if (IS_ERR(my_file)) {
    pr_err("Failed to open file\n");
    // Handle the error
}
```

In this example, `my_file` represents an open file descriptor for a file located at "/path/to/myfile." It can be used to perform file-related operations such as reading and writing.

These data structures and header files (`fs.h`) are essential components of the Linux kernel's file handling subsystem, enabling drivers, filesystems, and applications to work with files in a standardized and efficient manner.

7. **`struct cdev` and `struct inode`:**
   - Used for character device registration and management.
   - Example (character device registration):
     ```c
     static struct cdev my_cdev;
     cdev_init(&my_cdev, &my_fops);
     ```
`struct cdev` and `struct inode` are core data structures used in the Linux kernel for character device handling. Here's an explanation of these structures along with their associated header files:

### `struct cdev`:

- **Description:** `struct cdev` represents a character device within the Linux kernel. It is used by device drivers to register and manage character devices. A character device is a type of device that communicates data as a stream of bytes and is typically accessed through files in the `/dev` directory.

- **Header File:** `<linux/cdev.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.kobj`: A kernel object that provides a standardized interface for character devices.
  - `.ops`: A pointer to a structure containing function pointers for various character device operations, such as open, release, read, and write.
  - `.owner`: A pointer to the module that owns the character device.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/cdev.h>

struct cdev my_cdev;
cdev_init(&my_cdev, &my_fops);  // Initialize with file operations
```

In this example, `my_cdev` represents a character device, and it is initialized with a set of file operations (`my_fops`) that define how the device should behave when accessed.

### `struct inode`:

- **Description:** `struct inode` represents an in-memory data structure that describes a file or directory in the Linux kernel's filesystem. It contains metadata about the file, such as its type, permissions, size, and pointers to data blocks. `struct inode` is used extensively in filesystem-related code.

- **Header File:** `<linux/fs.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.i_sb`: A pointer to the superblock that contains filesystem-specific information.
  - `.i_mode`: A bitmask representing the file's type and permissions.
  - `.i_size`: The size of the file in bytes.
  - `.i_private`: A pointer to filesystem-specific data associated with the file.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/fs.h>

struct inode *my_inode;
my_inode = inode_alloc(sb);  // Allocate an inode
```

In this example, `my_inode` represents an allocated inode for a file within the filesystem. In practice, inodes are typically managed by the filesystem and are not directly created or allocated by device drivers.

These data structures, along with their respective header files (`<linux/cdev.h>` and `<linux/fs.h>`), are fundamental to character device handling and filesystem management in the Linux kernel. They enable device drivers to interact with character devices and provide the necessary infrastructure for managing files and directories in the filesystem.

8. **`struct work_struct` and `struct delayed_work`:**
   - Used for work queue and deferred work execution.
   - Example (work initialization):
     ```c
     struct work_struct my_work;
     INIT_WORK(&my_work, my_work_handler);
     ```


`struct work_struct` and `struct delayed_work` are data structures used for work queue management in the Linux kernel. They allow the execution of tasks or functions in a deferred manner. Here's an explanation of these structures along with their associated header files:

### `struct work_struct`:

- **Description:** `struct work_struct` represents a task or work item that can be scheduled to be executed asynchronously in the kernel. It is used for performing non-blocking, deferred work. Tasks scheduled with `struct work_struct` are typically executed by kernel worker threads.

- **Header File:** `<linux/workqueue.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.entry`: An internal field used for managing the work item within a linked list.
  - No user-visible attributes. The structure itself is typically embedded within a larger data structure containing additional context information.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/workqueue.h>

struct work_struct my_work;
INIT_WORK(&my_work, my_work_handler);  // Initialize the work item
```

In this example, `my_work` represents a work item, and it is initialized with a work handler function `my_work_handler`. When scheduled, `my_work_handler` will be executed asynchronously by a kernel worker thread.

### `struct delayed_work`:

- **Description:** `struct delayed_work` is an extension of `struct work_struct` that allows you to schedule work to run after a specified delay. It's useful for scheduling tasks to be executed at a future time or after a certain period.

- **Header File:** `<linux/workqueue.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.work`: A `struct work_struct` that is the core work item.
  - `.timer`: An embedded timer that allows you to specify the delay before the work is executed.
  - No user-visible attributes beyond those inherited from `struct work_struct`.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/workqueue.h>

struct delayed_work my_delayed_work;
INIT_DELAYED_WORK(&my_delayed_work, my_delayed_work_handler);  // Initialize the delayed work item
```

In this example, `my_delayed_work` represents a delayed work item, and it is initialized with a delayed work handler function `my_delayed_work_handler`. The work handler will be executed after the specified delay.

These data structures, along with their header file (`<linux/workqueue.h>`), are crucial for scheduling and managing asynchronous tasks in the Linux kernel. They enable efficient handling of deferred work without blocking the main execution flow of the kernel.

9. **`struct notifier_block`:**
   - Used for registering and handling notification events.
   - Example (notification registration):
     ```c
     static struct notifier_block my_notifier = {
         .notifier_call = my_notification_handler,
     };
     ```
     `struct notifier_block` is a data structure used for registering and handling notification events in the Linux kernel. It is commonly used by different subsystems to notify interested parties about specific events. Here's an explanation of `struct notifier_block` along with its associated header file:

### `struct notifier_block`:

- **Description:** `struct notifier_block` is a structure used to define callback functions for notification events. It allows components to register themselves as listeners for specific events and execute custom code when those events occur. `struct notifier_block` is commonly used for event-driven scenarios in the kernel.

- **Header File:** `<linux/notifier.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.notifier_call`: A function pointer to the callback function that will be invoked when the event occurs.
  - `.priority`: An integer that specifies the priority of the listener. Listeners with higher priorities are called before listeners with lower priorities for the same event.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/notifier.h>

static int my_notification_handler(struct notifier_block *nb, unsigned long event, void *data) {
    // Custom handling for the notification event
    // ...
    return NOTIFY_OK;  // Return NOTIFY_OK to indicate successful handling
}

struct notifier_block my_notifier = {
    .notifier_call = my_notification_handler,
    .priority = 0,  // Priority for the listener
};
```

In this example, `my_notifier` is a `struct notifier_block` representing a listener for a specific event. It is initialized with a callback function `my_notification_handler`, which gets called when the event occurs.

The header file `<linux/notifier.h>` contains the definition of `struct notifier_block` and related macros for registering and managing notification callbacks.

`struct notifier_block` is a powerful mechanism for enabling communication between different parts of the kernel and between kernel modules. It allows subsystems to notify interested parties about important events, facilitating extensibility and customization in the Linux kernel.

10. ****`struct of_device_id`:**
`struct of_device_id` is a data structure used in the Linux kernel for matching platform devices with compatible entries in the Device Tree. It is commonly used by platform drivers to identify and bind to specific devices based on their compatible properties defined in the Device Tree. Here's an explanation of `struct of_device_id` along with its associated header file:

### `struct of_device_id`:

- **Description:** `struct of_device_id` is a structure used to define a matching table that associates compatible strings (compatible property values from the Device Tree) with a driver. It enables the kernel to identify devices that are compatible with a specific driver and allows the driver to bind to those devices.

- **Header File:** `<linux/of.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.compatible`: A string that specifies the compatible property value in the Device Tree that should match the driver.
  - `.data`: An optional pointer to device-specific data that can be associated with the matched device.
  
**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/of.h>

static const struct of_device_id my_of_match[] = {
    { .compatible = "my-device", },
    { .compatible = "another-device", },
    { /* Sentinel */ },
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, my_of_match);
```

In this example, `my_of_match` is a `struct of_device_id` array that defines a matching table for a driver. It lists compatible property values, such as "my-device" and "another-device." The `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, ...)` macro is used to generate the necessary code for device tree-based probing and binding.

The header file `<linux/of.h>` contains the definition of `struct of_device_id` and related macros for working with Device Tree data and device tree-based probing in Linux kernel drivers.


11. **`struct i2c_device_id`:**

`struct i2c_device_id` is a data structure used for device driver matching in the context of I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) devices in the Linux kernel. It allows drivers to match and bind to I2C devices based on specific identifiers such as the device's name or compatible string. Here's information about `struct i2c_device_id` and the associated header file:

- **Purpose:** `struct i2c_device_id` is used for I2C device driver matching. It enables drivers to match with specific I2C devices based on characteristics like the device name or compatible string, making it easier to bind drivers to the appropriate devices.

- **Header File:** `<linux/i2c.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.name`: A string representing the name of the I2C device. This is used for matching the driver to the device.
  - `.driver_data`: An integer value associated with the device. It can be used by the driver for device-specific data or configuration.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static const struct i2c_device_id my_i2c_device_id[] = {
    { "my-device-1", 1 },
    { "my-device-2", 2 },
    { "another-device", 3 },
    { /* Sentinel */ },
};
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c, my_i2c_device_id);
```

In this example, `my_i2c_device_id` is an array of `struct i2c_device_id` that defines a matching table for an I2C driver. It lists different I2C device names along with associated `driver_data` values.

The `MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(i2c, ...)` macro generates the necessary code to create a module-level device table, allowing the driver to match with I2C devices based on their names or other characteristics.

The header file `<linux/i2c.h>` contains the definition of `struct i2c_device_id` and related macros for working with I2C device driver matching in the Linux kernel.

12. **`struct i2c_board_info`:**

`struct i2c_board_info` is a data structure used in the Linux kernel to describe I2C devices that should be registered during the kernel's boot process. It is used for defining device information, such as the I2C address, name, and platform-specific data. Here's information about `struct i2c_board_info` and the associated header file:

- **Purpose:** `struct i2c_board_info` is used to describe I2C devices that should be automatically registered during kernel initialization. It is commonly used for static device configuration and registration.

- **Header File:** `<linux/i2c.h>`

- **Key Attributes:**
  - `.type`: An integer specifying the type or driver identifier for the I2C device.
  - `.addr`: The I2C address of the device.
  - `.flags`: Flags that control the device registration, such as specifying that the device is detectable or specifying platform-specific flags.
  - `.irq`: The interrupt request line associated with the device, if applicable.
  - `.platform_data`: A pointer to platform-specific data that can be associated with the device.

**Example Usage:**
```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static struct i2c_board_info my_i2c_devices[] = {
    {
        I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-1", 0x42),
        .platform_data = (void *)&my_device_1_data,
    },
    {
        I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-2", 0x50),
        .irq = IRQ_GPIO(4),  // Example GPIO-based IRQ
    },
    { },

```

In this example, `my_i2c_devices` is an array of `struct i2c_board_info` that describes I2C devices. Each entry provides information about the device, including its name, I2C address, and optionally, platform-specific data or IRQ configuration.

The header file `<linux/i2c.h>` contains the definition of `struct i2c_board_info` and related macros for working with I2C device information and registration in the Linux kernel.

### `I2C_BOARD_INFO()`

The `I2C_BOARD_INFO()` macro is used to initialize an instance of `struct i2c_board_info` with some common fields. It simplifies the process of populating the structure with default values for the device name and I2C address. Here's the syntax and usage of `I2C_BOARD_INFO()`:

```c
I2C_BOARD_INFO(device_name, i2c_address)
```

- `device_name`: A string that specifies the name of the I2C device. This is a human-readable identifier for the device.

- `i2c_address`: An integer that represents the I2C address of the device on the I2C bus.

Here's an example of how to use `I2C_BOARD_INFO()`:

```c
#include <linux/i2c.h>

static struct i2c_board_info my_i2c_devices[] = {
    I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-1", 0x42),  // Initialize with device name and I2C address
    I2C_BOARD_INFO("my-device-2", 0x50),  // Another device
    { },
};
```

In this example, `my_i2c_devices` is an array of `struct i2c_board_info` that describes I2C devices. The `I2C_BOARD_INFO()` macro is used to initialize each entry with a device name and I2C address. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable by providing default values for these common fields.

The `I2C_BOARD_INFO()` macro is particularly useful when you have multiple I2C devices to describe, and it helps reduce repetitive code for initializing these common fields.

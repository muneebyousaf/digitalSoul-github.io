# Extract the contents of a split RAR archive

In order  to extract the contents of a split RAR archive using the `unrar` command. 

1. Ensure you have the `unrar` utility installed on your system. If it's not installed, you can typically install it using your system's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install it with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install unrar
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory where all the parts of the split RAR archive are located.

3. Run the `unrar x` command followed by the name of the first part of the RAR archive. In your case, it seems to be "XXXXX_YYYY.part01_Downloadly.ir.rar." Here's the command:

   ```bash
   unrar x XXXXX_YYYY.part01_Downloadly.ir.rar
   ```

4. The `unrar` utility should start extracting the contents of the split RAR archive. It will automatically locate and use the other parts of the archive (assuming they are all in the same directory) to complete the extraction.

After running this command, the contents of the RAR archive should be extracted to the current directory or a subdirectory, depending on the archive's structure. You can then access the extracted files and folders.

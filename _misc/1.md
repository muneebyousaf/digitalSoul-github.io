# Installing windows 7 on ubuntu 22.04 with virtual box

**Step 1: Install Guest Additions**
1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu 22.04 host.

2. Run the following command to install the required VirtualBox Guest Additions package:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install virtualbox-guest-additions-iso
   ```

3. After the installation is complete, you need to mount the Guest Additions ISO to your virtual machine. To do this, first, make sure your Windows 7 guest is running.

4. In the VirtualBox menu, go to "Devices" and select "Insert Guest Additions CD Image." This will mount the ISO inside your Windows 7 guest.

5. Inside your Windows 7 guest, open Windows Explorer, and navigate to "Computer." You should see the CD/DVD drive labeled "VBOXADDITIONS_xxx" (xxx represents the version number). Run the appropriate installer for your system (usually, it's VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe).

6. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. This will also create the 'vboxsf' group on your Ubuntu host.

7. After the installation is complete, restart your Windows 7 guest.

8. Now, you should be able to access shared folders between your Windows 7 guest and Ubuntu host as described in the previous instructions.






**Step 2: Set Up Shared Folder on Host**

Now, you need to configure the shared folder on your Ubuntu 22.04 host:

1. In Ubuntu, create a folder that you want to share with your Windows 7 guest. For example, let's call it "SharedFolder" and place it in your home directory.



**Step 3: Configure Shared Folder in VirtualBox**

Now, you'll configure the shared folder in VirtualBox:

1. In VirtualBox, with your Windows 7 guest powered off, select your virtual machine from the list and click on "Settings."

2. Navigate to the "Shared Folders" section.

3. Click on the "Add new shared folder" icon (a folder with a plus sign).

4. In the "Folder Path" field, browse and select the folder you want to share from your Ubuntu host (e.g., `/home/yourusername/SharedFolder`).

5. In the "Folder Name" field, enter a name for the shared folder (e.g., "SharedFolder").

6. Check the "Auto-mount" option if you want the shared folder to be automatically mounted in your Windows 7 guest when it starts.

7. Click "OK" to save the settings.

**Step 4: Access Shared Folder in Windows 7**

Now, you can access the shared folder from your Windows 7 guest:

1. Start your Windows 7 virtual machine.

2. Open File Explorer in Windows 7.

3. In the left sidebar, under "This PC" or "Computer," you should see a new network location labeled "VBOXSVR." This represents the shared folder from your host.

4. Double-click on "VBOXSVR" to access the shared folder.

You can now copy files to and from the shared folder as needed. It should function like any other networked drive in your Windows 7 guest.
